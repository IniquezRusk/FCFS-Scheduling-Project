Overview:

This github contains the C++ program of calculating the FCFS scheduling algorithm. There is a user case to see how it is ran, and then a user input case which allows
the user to input their own values into the program and run it following the algorithm. There is a live count of when a process is ran and when it ends,
and a table will output at the end of the code to show all statistics, calculations, and final result.
